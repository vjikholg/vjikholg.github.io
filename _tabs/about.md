Hi, I'm Victor. I primarily studied  **Math and some Computer Science** at the University of British Columbia (UBC) with an interest in Algebra and Number Theory. I particularly like mapping ideas from Algebra to solve problems in Computer Science in some clever, weird ways. 

I like Math, Astrophotography, Philosophy. Here is a picture of Orion's Belt I took in Winter 2024:

If you're interested in what I'm working on, you can check out my projects [here](https://github.com/vjikholg). Otherwise, I'm currently working throuhg Artin's Algebra and Hulpke's Computational Group Theory Handbook.
